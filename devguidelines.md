Use this file to provide the AI with rules and guidelines you want it to follow.
This template outlines a few examples of things you can add. You can add your own sections and format it to suit your needs

TIP: More context isn't always better. It can confuse the LLM. Try and add the most important rules you need

# General guidelines

* Only use absolute positioning when necessary. Opt for responsive and well structured layouts that use flexbox and grid by default
* Refactor code as you go to keep code clean.
* Keep file sizes small and put helper functions and components in their own files.
* Only use the packages installed for development.
* Write clean, readable code with meaningful variable and function names
* Test responsive behavior at mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints
* Implement proper form validation with clear error messages
* Include loading states for all async operations
* **Always prioritize content readability**: Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and backgrounds, use appropriate font sizes, and maintain visual hierarchy throughout the application
